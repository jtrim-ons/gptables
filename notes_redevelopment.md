# Notes Redevelopment

## Research findings

### Coversation with Hannah Thomas
Guidance went through Presentation and Dissemination Champions and Comms Committee, other user research limited. Insight from accessibility surgeries:
- Main thing on notes is getting people to move away from them being under tables (this is especially problematic when tables are longer than page height)
- General rule is to explain any shorthand above table, and signpost to notes in notes sheet
- Even if only one note, generally preferable to use a notes table in notes sheets
- Notes table in coversheet can cause formatting issues, so separate sheet recommended
- Ideally, should have cover sheet as well, and table of contents sheet if there is more than one table


## Design ideas

### Notes
Note text in notes table on notes sheet. Signposting to notes above table and referencing in column headers where appropriate.
Might be possible to repurpose cover sheet code to generate notes sheet and construst notes page using similar interface. User research needed to see whether users would prefer to provide an imput file with note text, and if so, what format would be best.

### Cells with no data shorthand
Repurpose current empty cell function to raise error informing users that their table contains empty cells that should be repaced with shorthand. User research needed to see whether users would prefer to fill missing entries with shorthand themselves or input a cell range and missingness cause, and the package adds in the shorthand.
